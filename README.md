# Centralised-Log-System
A centralised log system for Linux based operating systems.  
Simply clone the repository and set a cronjob in order to collect the logs. You can customise the files which are logged and stored, sort them in priority, etc. Use -h or --help to understand the possible configurations.
This repository is not much relevant with current time when there are greater apps (both open source and pro) available for same task. Marking it out dated is not much far as well.
I am not maintaining this repository any longer. (Can't be certain to that xD) Although working on a way to analyse these logs and packet captured files. A part of that is my pyplico repository. Cheers!
